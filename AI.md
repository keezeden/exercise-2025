# AI Usage

I usually use `codex` (I was an avid `claude` user, but feel `codex` is much better at being surgical in its changes without rewriting your entire project) and generally use it for high level code search, architecture and design questions, and small supervised tasks or boilerplate.

## Prompts

"Look at the README.md tasks and give a high level direction of where to start investigating these tasks"
"Write a small useDebounce hook in src/lib/hooks/debounce.ts"
"Write a loading skeleton component in src/components/loading.tsx that has variants for vertical and horizontal rendering and takes styling props"
"Look at src/lib/workflows/registration.ts how you would refactor this to use Effect"
"Refactor the code to hoist the errors, and use Effect.tryPromise"
"Investigate the regex in /src/components/performance-demo-item and why the text is not highlighting correctly"
